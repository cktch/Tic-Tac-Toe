# Tic-Tac-Toe

I present the classic game of 'X' and 'O' vs. Computer or AI (Artificial Intelligence), who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.

This simple Tic-tac-toe game made using Python.

Player can input “1”, ”2”, ”3”, etc to mark their decision.

Inputs are validated (characters are rejected & only allows empty spot to be selected).

Starting the game turns randomly between player and AI.

I include the design and description of the algorithm using flowchart to show the flow of the program in the pdf.
