# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe game using Python. 

Display follow a 3x3 grid system.

Player can input “1”, ”2”, ”3”, etc to mark their decision.

Inputs are validated (characters are rejected & only allows empty spot to be selected).

Starting the game turns randomly between player and AI.

I include the design and description of the algorithm using flowchart to show the flow of the program in the pdf.
